This repository contains a Python program demonstrating a common error related to recursion depth. The 'bug.py' file shows the faulty recursive function which causes the error. The 'bugSolution.py' file provides a corrected version that demonstrates how to handle the issue appropriately.  The error arises when the base case is not reached within the allowed recursion depth.  The solution includes a check to prevent infinite recursion.
